# Documentation Site Issue Tracker

Welcome to the issue tracker for the documentation site, available at [https://javadoc.flowingcode.com/](https://javadoc.flowingcode.com/).

We at Flowing Code believe that open source is key to fostering innovation and collaboration.
Our documentation site upholds this principle by serving both our projects and the broader open source community.

If you would like us to host the Javadocs for your project, please [submit a request](https://github.com/FlowingCode/javadoc-site/issues/new?template=javadoc.yml&title=Add+groupId%3AartifactId) with the relevant details. (No SLA, but we've got you covered! ;-)

## Features

- On-Demand Retrieval: Fetches the most up-to-date Javadoc documentation as needed.
- Multiple Version Support: Handles requests for various artifact versions and redirects to the latest version if no specific version is provided.
- Snapshot Support: Handles both releases and snapshot versions of artifacts.
- Version Selector: Allows users to switch between different versions of the documentation.
- Caching: Maintains a cache of artifact versions in geographically distributed data centers.
